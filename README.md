# PhytoChem-Tracker
this represents an AI-built and designed phytochemical intelligence platform for rapid retrieval of phytochemical data
PhytoChem-Tracker (PCT) was assembled and built utilizing the AI tools of Google Gemini 3.0 and Google Antigravity for satisfaction of the final project requirements of CS5047. There are still bugs to be worked out, so this is version 1.0 of PCT

# PhytoChem-Tracker

**PhytoChem-Tracker** is an Agentic AI platform designed for biochemists and phytochemical engineers. It utilizes **Google Gemini 3.0** to orchestrate searches across chemical databases (PubChem), spectral libraries (GNPS), and genomic resources (Phytozome).

### Features
*   **Agentic Orchestration**: Automates lookups for physico-chemical properties, spectra, and gene IDs.
*   **Ranked Phytochemicals**: Identifies top compounds in species based on literature citation frequency.
*   **PDF Reporting**: Generates downloadable reports for research.
